# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This repository contains code and resources for MRI brain tumor classification using three different datasets. Each dataset consists of MRI images categorized into various classes representing different types of brain tumors.

1. [Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri): Brain Tumor 4 class
   - glioma_tumor
   - meningioma_tumor
   - no_tumor
   - pituitary_tumor
  
2. [Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernando2rad/brain-tumor-mri-images-44c/data): Brain Tumor MRI Images 44 classes
   - A private collection of T1, contrast-enhanced T1, and T2 magnetic resonance images separated by brain tumor type.
   - Interpreted by radiologists and provided for study purposes

3. [Dataset 3](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernando2rad/brain-tumor-mri-images-44c/data): Brain Tumor MRI Images 15 classes
   - The images are separated by astrocytoma, carcinoma, ependymoma, ganglioglioma, germinoma, glioblastoma, granuloma, medulloblastoma, meningioma, neurocytoma, oligodendroglioma, papilloma, schwannoma and tuberculoma.
